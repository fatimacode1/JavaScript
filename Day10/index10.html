    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The Solar System</b> is the gravitationally bound system of the
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sun">Sun</a> and the objects that
      orbit it. It formed <b>4.6 billion years ago</b> from the gravitational
      collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority
      (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining
      mass contained in the planet
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The four
      inner system planets—<a href="#">Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars</a>—are
      terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four
      giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more
      massive than the terrestrials.

    <h2>Formation & Evolution</h2>
    <p id="description">
      The Solar System formed from a dense region of a molecular cloud that
      collapsed to form the Sun and a protoplanetary disk. The Sun grew larger
      by accreting mass from this disk, and the planets formed from the
      remaining material. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6
      billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains on Earth are
      approximately 4.4 billion years old, suggesting that Earth formed not long
      after the Solar System itself. Computer simulations show that the planets
      likely formed through a process called accretion, where dust and gas
      gradually came together over millions of years. The inner planets formed
      closer to the Sun where it was too hot for volatile compounds to remain
      solid, while the outer planets formed in the cooler regions where ices
      could form.
